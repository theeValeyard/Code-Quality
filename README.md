# Code quality checklist-

[-] Use Git (or any version control software) to track your progress
[-] Check for bugs, errors, and potential risks to make sure your code works as desired
[-] Explain the reason for any code that’s commented out to ensure there is no dead code
[-] Use each function for a single task and make sure the entire function is viewable on a single screen
[-] Don’t over-optimize your code, make sure you understand all of it when you review it
[-] Use a coding standard to maintain consistency & readability
[-] Document it well with descriptive comments and commits
[-] Make sure the code is not repeated or duplicated
[-] Review, analyze, and test your code for quality assurance
[-] Make sure it is easy to maintain and others can contribute to it
[-] Keep your code concise and automate testing when possible
[-] Have an emergency backup
[-] Don't rely too much on plugins to help you code, it can make it complicated for other developers who work on the project. Keep it simple

# Self-evaluation scale - 2/4

I think a simple but thorough checklist like this works well for me. I think a task-based checklist can also be very handy but this approach works better for me as I'm doing more than one thing at a time. I tend to get distracted if I only check for one thing at a time like the GitHub checklist. I added a few things that my checklist was initially missing. I think it would work.
